This project explores key areas of computer security through two main components: malware research and cryptography. It investigates several newly discovered malware variants, explaining how they spread, how systems can be protected, and what recovery steps are effective. The cryptography section demonstrates practical encryption and decryption using a symmetric key algorithm, supported by short programming tasks and explanations of concepts such as padding, RSA, DES, and digital signatures. Together, the work combines applied coding with theoretical understanding to illustrate core principles of cybersecurity and data protection.
